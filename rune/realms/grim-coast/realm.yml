      A curse hangs over you, something looms from the grave and sticks to your
      skin.

  Icy wind blows against your grave marked skin. A heavy weight hangs in the air
  of the Grim Coast. Atop a hill in the distance, a singular Keep stands above
  a desolate land.
  Carving the Sigil into the ground, you prepare yourself.
